_to everyone that reads this,_

**or doesn't read this as i don't matter to anyone honestly. **I really did try and live a life, a life dedicated to being happy. I was unable too, for every person I've loved has left me. I'm terrified of everything, and I don't know how to feel better, at 26 i've only been able to accomplish laying in a bed every day and hurting other people. 

 so i leave this as my final goodbye.
